# Package Savant

**Package Savant** is a generic repository provider written in [Go](https://golang.org).

Package Savant's features include:

* **Lightweight**: comparable solutions require several gigabytes of memory to run optimally, whereas Package Savant works well regardless of where you're hosting your repositories, be it a high-end server or a Raspberry Pi.
* **Open source**: licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
* **Easy to dive into**: setting up Package Savant is simple, and the codebase is simple to read.

There are some current limitations:

* **Only Maven repositories are supported**: Support for others will be added once Package Savant is stable.
* **Alpha-quality**: We do not recommend running Package Savant in production just yet.
